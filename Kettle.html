		<p>A kettle, sometimes called a tea kettle or teakettle, 
		is a type of pot specialized for boiling water, commonly with a lid, spout, 
		and handle, or a small electric kitchen appliance of similar shape that 
		functions in a self-contained manner. Kettles can be heated either by
		placing on a stove, or by their own internal electric heating element
		in the appliance versions. As indicated by its name, 
		the kettle was and is often used as teaware to brew tea or prepare a tisane.</p>
